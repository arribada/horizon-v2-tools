## Arribada Horizon Bio-Logging Platform

The **Arribada Horizon** bio-logging platform provides the building blocks necessary to develop customised bio-logging tags. Essential functionality is included as standard (GPS, Tri-axial accelerometer, Bluetooth 5). In addition, a picoblade expansion socket allows third party radio modules / additional daughterboards to be connected as required.

The platform was developed by the [Arribada Initiative](http://arribada.org) and the [Zoological Society of London](https://www.zsl.org/conservation/how-we-work/conservation-technology) to unlock access to low-cost open source bio-logging technology.

There are currently two releases;

- **Arribada Horizon v2.0** (STM32 based)
- **Arribada Horizon v3.0** (nRF52840 based)
